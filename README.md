# Early-detection-of-Breast-cancer
Breast Cancer is the world's Second Cause of Death. A delayed detection of cancerous tissue growth in a patient is the key reason for this increased death rate. Up to 60 per cent of breast cancer patients are diagnosed in later stages. Our paper's main purpose is to develop an image processing algorithm with the help of MATLAB and by classifying it using machine learning techniques for earlier breast cancer detection. The obtained mammogram images are used as input data.Pre-processing of input images is achieved by applying modified CLAHE techniques to improve the quality of the images. The gray threshold algorithm is used to remove pectoral muscles in a mammogram.feature extraction is performed in a matlab and these texture parameters are then used to classify various techniques in machine learning.In testing phase, after completion of image processing steps such as Pre-processing and extraction of features, the statistic parameters are given to the classifier as input. The classifier's performance is made up of two classes, usual and abnormal respectively. The machine learning algorithm is developed in python language. The processing time for Genuine case testing and confirmation is very low. A 82 per cent accuracy rate is achieved using logistic regression classifiers.
